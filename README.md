This repository contains the Final Project for ECE NTUA course Multi Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA)

## Description:

Multiple-Criteria Decision analysis (MCDA) techniques enhanced with Deep Learning Techniques to solve a Securities Selection (Stocks) problem

## What is interactive multiobjective optimization?
There exist many methods to solve multiobjective optimization problems. Methods which introduce some preference information into the solution process are commonly known as multiple criteria decision making methods. 

**Multiple-criteria decision analysis (MCDA)** is a sub-discipline of operations research that explicitly evaluates multiple conflicting criteria in decision making (both in daily life and in settings such as business, government and medicine). Conflicting criteria are typical in evaluating options: cost or price is usually one of the main criteria, and some measure of quality is typically another criterion
